# Pico-8 Library
This project is intended to be a good looking display and presentation tool for a library of Pico-8 cartridges. A user may grab a box off of the library shelf and look at the 3d box art (front and back). The user can then either put the box back, or opt to play the cartridge. If the user opts to play the cartridge the screen will scroll up to a shelf above the library shelf and a tv-like screen will load the cartridge.

## Technology
Pico-8 Library is built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, and jQuery UI. Additionally, it utilizes JS exports of Pico-8 cartridges (all of which were coded in Lua for the Pico-8 virtual console).
