# Pico-8 Library
This project is intended to be a good looking display and presentation tool for a library of Pico-8 cartridges. In its current state you can grab a box off of the library shelf and look at the box (front and back). Coming soon is the ability to insert cartridges into a console and view them on a virtual TV.
## Technology
Pico-8 Library is built with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and jQuery UI. Additionally, it utilizes JS exports of Pico-8 cartridges.
