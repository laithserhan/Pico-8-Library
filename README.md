# Pico-8-Library
This project is intended to be a good looking display and presentation tool for a library of Pico-8 cartridges. In its current state you can grab a box off of the library shelf and look at the box (front and back). Coming soon is the ability to insert cartridges into a console and view them on a virtual TV.
